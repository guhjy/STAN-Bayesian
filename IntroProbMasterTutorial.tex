\section*{The factorial function}
The factorial function (symbol: !) just means to multiply a series of descending natural numbers. Examples:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24$
	\item $7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5,040$
	\item $1! = 1$
	\item $0! = 1 $
\end{itemize}
Importantly 
\[n! = n \times (n-1)!  = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2)! \]
For Example
\[6! = 6 \times 5!  = 6 \times 5 \times 4! \]

		\begin{itemize}
			\item ${6 \choose 2} = 15$

			\item ${4 \choose 0} = 1$  
			\item ${4 \choose 3} = 4$  
		\end{itemize}

			\begin{itemize}
				\item factorials 
				\[ n! = (n)\times (n-1)\times(n-2) \times \ldots \times 1 \]

				\item Zero factorial
				\[ 0! =  1 \]

		\[ \frac{6!}{3! \times 3!} = \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3!}{3! \times 3!} = \frac{120}{6} = 120\]

%%- \frametitle{Factorials Numbers}

A factorial is a positive whole number, based on a number $n$ , and which is written as $``n!"$. The factorial $n!$ is defined as follows:

\[n!  =n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \ldots \times 2 \times 1 \]

Remark $n!  =n \times (n-1)!$\\ \bigskip

\textbf{ Example: }

\begin{itemize}
	\item $3!  = 3 \times 2  \times 1 = 6 $
	
	\item $4!  = 4 \times 3! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24$
\end{itemize}
Remark $0! = 1$ not $0$.

		\begin{itemize}
			\item The notion of permutation relates to the act of permuting (rearranging) objects or values. 
			\item Informally, a permutation of a set of objects is an arrangement of those objects into a particular order. 
			
			\item For example, there are six permutations of the set $\{1,2,3\}$, namely (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1). 
			\item As another example, an anagram of a word is a permutation of its letters.

		\textbf{Part 1 : ANSWER}\\
		Examples:
		\begin{center}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item The word PERMUTE has 7 letters, but only 6 different letters. 
			\item There are 7! ways to arrange 7 letters.

		\textbf{Part 3 : ANAGRAM}\\
		\begin{itemize}
			\item We divide 7! by 3! to account for the identical anagrams.

			\item From before, there are 6! ways to arrange 6 letters.
			\item Again, interchanging the two Ls and Ts does not result in a new permutation. 
			\LARGE
			\[\frac{6!}{2!\times 2!} =  \frac{720}{4} = \boldsymbol{180} \]

		\subsection{Permutation Formula}
		
		A formula for the number of possible permutations of k objects from a set of n. This is usually written $^nP_k$ .
		
		\bigskip
		\textbf{Formula:}	
		\[ ^nP_k = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} =  n.(n-1).(n-2).\ldots(n-k+1) \]
		
		
		
		\textbf{Example:}\\	
		How many ways can 4 students from a group of 15 be lined up for a photograph?\\
		\bigskip
		%--------------- %
		\textbf{Answer:	}\\
		There are $^{15}P_4$ possible permutations of 4 students from a group of 15.
		\[ ^{15}P_4 = \frac{15!}{11!} = 15\times 14\times 13\times 12 = 32760 \]
		There are 32760 different lineups.

%% \frametitle{Continuous Random variables}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Previously we have been studying discrete random variables, such as the Binomial and the Poisson random variables.
	\item Now we turn our attention to continuous random variables.
	\item Recall that a continuous random variable is one which takes an infinite number of possible values, rather than just a countable number of distinct values.
	\item Continuous random variables are usually measurements.
	\item Examples include height, weight, the amount of sugar in an orange, the time required to run a mile.

{\LARGE
	%% \frametitle{Exact Probabilities}
	\large
	\textbf{Remarks:} This is for continuous distributions only.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The probability that a continuous random variable will take an exact value is infinitely small.
		We will usually treat it as if it was zero.
		\item
		When we write probabilities for continuous random variables in mathematical notation, we often retain the equality component (i.e. the "...or equal to..").\\
		For example, we would write expressions $P(X \leq 2)$ or $P(X \geq 5)$.
		\item
		Because the probability of an exact value is almost zero, these two expression are equivalent to $P(X < 2)$
		or $P(X > 5)$. \item Also, the complement of $P(X \geq k)$ can be written as $P(X \leq k)$.

	%% \frametitle{Probability Density Function}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		In probability theory, a \textbf{\emph{probability density function}} (PDF) (or ``density" for short ) of a continuous random variable is a function that describes the relative likelihood for this random variable to occur at a given point.
		
		\item The PDF for a continuous random variable $X$ is often denoted $f(x)$.
		
		\item The probability density function can be integrated to obtain the probability that the random variable takes a value in a given interval.
		
		\item The probability for the random variable to fall within a particular interval is given by the integral of this variable's density over the region.
		
		\item The probability density function is non-negative everywhere, and its integral over the entire space is equal to one.
	\end{itemize}
}

%% ----------------------------------%%

%% \frametitle{Density Curves}


\begin{itemize}
	\item A plot of the PDF is referred to as a `\textbf{\emph{density curve}}'.
	\item A density curve that is always on or above the horizontal axis and has total area underneath equal to one.
	\item Area under the curve in a range of values indicates the proportion of values in that range.
	\item Density curves come in a variety of shapes, but the normal distribution's bell-shaped densities are perhaps the most commonly encountered.
	\item Remember the density is only an approximation, but it simplifies analysis and is generally accurate enough for practical use.

		\[ F(x) = P(X \leq x) \]

	If X is a continuous random variable then we can say that the probability of obtaining a \textbf{precise} value $x$ is infinitely small, i.e. close to zero.
	
	\[P(X=x) \approx 0 \]
	
	Consequently, for continuous random variables (only),  $P(X \leq x)$ and $P(X < x)$ can be used interchangeably.
	
	\[P(X \leq x) \approx P(X < x) \]

	%% \frametitle{Continuous Uniform Distribution}

	\[ f_{X}(x)  =  { 1 \over b-a}   \hspace{2cm}  \mbox{ when } a \leq x \leq b\]
	
	The corresponding cumulative density function is
	
	\[ F_x(x) = { x-a \over b-a}   \hspace{2cm}  \mbox{ when } a \leq x \leq b\]

{\LARGE
	%% \frametitle{The Memoryless property}
	The most interesting property of the exponential distribution is the \textbf{\emph{memoryless}} property. By this , we mean that if  the lifetime of a component is exponentially distributed, then an item which has been in use for some time is a good as a brand new item with regards to the likelihood of failure.
	
	The exponential distribution is the only distribution that has this property.

		A \textbf{\emph{random variable}} is a function that associates a unique numerical value with every outcome of an experiment.
		\item The value of the random variable will vary from trial to trial as the experiment is repeated.

%\frametitle{Probability Distribution}

%--------------------------------------%





%---------------------------------------%

A probability distribution is a mathematical approach to quantifying uncertainty.

There are two main classes of probability distributions: Discrete and continuous. 

Discrete distributions describe variables that take on discrete values only (typically the positive integers), while continuous 
distributions describe variables that can take on arbitrary values in a continuum (typically the real numbers).

%\frametitle{Poisson Distribution}

%--------------------------------------%





%---------------------------------------%

A basic introduction to the concept

Example

Certain events happen at unpredictable intervals. But for some reason, no matter how recent or long ago last event was, the probability that another event will occur within the next hour is exactly the same (say, 10%). The same holds for any other time interval (say, second). Moreover, the number of events within any given time interval is statistically independent of numbers of events in other intervals that do not overlap the given interval. Also, two events never occur simultaneously.

Then the number of events per day is Poisson distributed.

%---------------------------------------%
Formal definition

Let X be a stochastic variable taking non-negative integer values with probability density function

\[ P(X=k)=f(k)= e^{-\lambda} \frac{\lambda ^k}{k!}.\] 
Then X follows the Poisson distribution with parameter $\lambda$.

%---------------------------------------%
Characteristics of the Poisson distribution

If X is a Poisson distribution stochastic variable with parameter $\lambda$, then

\begin{itemize}
	\item The expected value $E[X]=\lambda$
	\item The variance $Var[X]=\lambda$
\end{itemize}

	\item $P(Z \geq 1.5) $
\end{itemize}

Consider the normally distributed random variable $X$

\[ X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu=1000,\sigma^2 = 2500) \]

\begin{itemize}
	\item $\mu =1000$
	\item $\sigma =50$

	\item $P(X \leq 925)$
	\item $P(X \geq 925)$

\[ X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu=1000,\sigma^2 = 2500) \]

\begin{itemize}
	\item Mean $\mu= 1000$
	\item Standard Deviation $\sigma = 50$
\end{itemize}

%---------------------------------------------------%

%\frametitle{Normal Distribution : The Symmetry Rule}

\[ P(X \leq 925)  = P(Z \leq -1.5) \]

Applying the Symmetry Rule
\[ P(Z \leq -1.5) = P(Z \geq 1.5) = 0.0668\]

Theerefore we can say 
\[ P(X \leq 925) = 0.0668 \]

%---------------------------------------------------%

%\frametitle{Standardizing normal random variables}

As a consequence of Property 1, it is possible to relate all normal random variables to the standard normal.

If $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, then

\[Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \]
is a standard normal random variable: $Z \sim N(0,1)$. An important consequence is that the cdf of a general normal distribution is therefore

\[\Pr(X \le x)
=
\Phi
\left(
\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
\right)
=
\frac{1}{2}
\left(
1 + \operatorname{erf}
\left(
\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma\sqrt{2}}
\right)
\right)\]
.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------%


Conversely, if Z is a standard normal distribution, $Z \sim N(0,1)$, then

\[X = \sigma Z + \mu\]
is a normal random variable with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$.

The standard normal distribution has been tabulated (usually in the form of value of the cumulative distribution function F), and the other normal distributions are the simple transformations, as described above, of the standard one. Therefore, one can use tabulated values of the cdf of the standard normal distribution to 
find values of the cdf of a general normal distribution.

How to Compute Probability: Equally Likely Outcomes
Sometimes, a statistical experiment can have n possible outcomes, each of which is equally likely. Suppose a subset of r outcomes are classified as "successful" outcomes.

The probability that the experiment results in a successful outcome (S) is:

P(S) = ( Number of successful outcomes ) / ( Total number of equally likely outcomes ) = r / n

Consider the following experiment. An urn has 10 marbles. Two marbles are red, three are green, and five are blue. If an experimenter randomly selects 1 marble from the urn, what is the probability that it will be green?

In this experiment, there are 10 equally likely outcomes, three of which are green marbles. Therefore, the probability of choosing a green marble is 3/10 or 0.30.

\section{Quantiles}

The quantile (this term was first used by Kendall, 1940) of a distribution of values is a number xp such that a proportion p of the population values are less than or equal to xp. For example, the .25 quantile (also referred to as the 25th percentile or lower quartile) of a variable is a value (xp) such that $25\%$ (p) of the values of the variable fall below that value.

Similarly, the $0.75$ quantile (also referred to as the 75th percentile or upper quartile) is a value such that $75\%$ of the values of the variable fall below that value and is calculated accordingly.

\section{Probability Distribution}

A statistical function that describes all the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range. This range will be between the minimum and maximum statistically possible values, but where the possible value is likely to be plotted on the probability distribution depends on a number of factors, including the distributions mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis.



\section{The binomial distribution }

The binomial distribution  is a discrete probability distribution that is applicable as a model for decisionmaking
situations in which a sampling process can be assumed to conform to a Bernoulli process. A Bernoulli
process is a sampling process in which
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] Only two mutually exclusive possible outcomes are possible in each trial, or observation. For
convenience these are called success and failure.
\item[(2)] The outcomes in the series of trials, or observations, constitute independent events.
\item[(3)] The probability of success in each trial, denoted by p, remains constant from trial to trial. That is,
the process is stationary.
\end{itemize}

The binomial distribution can be used to determine the probability of obtaining a designated number of
successes in a Bernoulli process. Three values are required: the designated number of successes (X); the number
of trials, or observations (n); and the probability of success in each trial (p). Where $q = (1 - p)$, the formula for
determining the probability of a specific number of successes X for a binomial distribution is

Today's class : Last years past paper 


Normal Distribution Question ( Dr David Ramsey's Equine Stats Class)

The mass of Arab horses is normally distributed with mean 900 lbs and standard deviation of 50lbs.
Part i Calculate the probability that an Arab horse weighs more than 940 lbs.


Solution

Let X be mass of Arab horses.

We have to find P(X940).            (Remark "equality component" is included as a formality, but it is not important)


Find the Z value that corresponds to 940 

Zo=Xo-=940 -90050= 0.8

P(X940) = P(Z0.8) 


From Murdoch Barnes tables 3, we find that  P(Z0.8) = 0.2119



Part ii Calculate the probability than an Arab horse weighs between 880 lbs and 960 lbs.
Solution 

P ( 880X960).


What proportion of horses are between 880 lbs and 960 lbs?

Find out the probability of the complement event.
The complement event is the combination of being too high  or too low for this interval.

Inside interval P ( 880X960).

Outside interval P (X880) +P(X960)

Complement Rule P ( 880X960)  = 1 - [P (X880) +P(X960)]



Find the probability of being too high?

Zo=Xo-=960 -90050= 1.2

P(X960) = P(Z1.2) = 0.1151


Find the probability of being too low?
Zo=Xo-=880 -90050= -0.4 
P(X880) = P(Z-0.4)  

How to compute P(Z-0.4)

Symmetry: 	P(Z-0.4) = P(Z0.4) = 0.3446


Outside Interval = 0.4596        (0.3446 +  0.1151)
Inside Interval = 0.5404



What weight is exceeded by 97.5% of Arab horses?

Find Xo  such that P(XXo) = 0.975


P(Z1.96) = 0.025     [From Tables] 

P(Z-1.96) = 0.025  [Symmetry]

P(Z-1.96) = 0.975         

-1.96 =Xo- 90050


Xo= 802 lbs  [Answer]

Standard deviation is the square root of the variance

SD=4.571=2.137



hypotheses

H0:D0    Students have not gained weight through college



Ha:D> 0    Students have  gained weight through college


N.B. This is a one-tailed test.

Test statistic

Remember the general structure of a test statistic

TS =Observed Value-Null ValueStd. Error 



Standard Error		S.E.(D) =SDn=2.1378= 0.7555

Test statistis is a t random variable

Test Statistic		x-0S.E.(D)=2 - 00.755= 2.649


Critical values

The sample size (n=8) is small (n30). Use t distribution with n-1 degrees of Freedom.


The test is one tailed.  k= 1  ( ">" symbol in the alternative hypothesis).


Column = k =0.051= 0.05


Murdoch Barnes table 7


Row: df = 7

Column = 0.05

Critical value =  1.895    

Decision rule


Is the test statistic value greater than the critical value?

If Yes: we reject the null hypothesis

If No: We fail to reject the null hypothesis. (not enough evidence)


Here TS = 2.64  is greater than CV = 1.895.


We reject the null hypothesis. Students do put on weight during college. 
Question 3 Part b : Confidence interval for the difference in means of two samples.

b) The mean and standard deviation of the weights of a sample of Irish students according to sex are given below


Number
Mean
Std. Dev.
Male
100
75
10
Female
110
66
8

i)        Calculate a 99% confidence interval for the difference between the mean weight of all male
students and the mean weight of all female students.(7 males)

General Structure of a Confidence Interval





Observed difference

let X denote the weights of male students    X= 75
let Y denote the weights of female students  Y= 66

The difference in the mean of weights X-Y= 9

Quantile

Large sample (both groups are greater than 30).

Population variance is unknown.
Use t distribution with  degrees of Freedom.


Confidence level is 99%. Therefore significance levels is 1%.
Confidence intervals are always two tailed procedures.


Column = k =0.012= 0.005


Murdoch Barnes table 7


Row: df =  
Column = 0.005

Quantile =  2.576 


Stardard Error






Confidence Interval is therefore

99% CI = 9(2.5761.256) 


Part (ii)
Based on this confidence interval, test the hypothesis that on average male students are 6kgs heavier than female students.
State your hypotheses clearly. What is the significance level of this test?   (3 marks)

H0:X-y= 6




Since  we do not reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 1%.






Question 4

a) The mean and standard deviation of the salaries of 16 Irish full-time workers are €5000  and €3000, respectively.

i)  Test the hypothesis that the mean salary of all Irish full-time workers is €4000 at a significance level of 5%.   (6 marks)



Step 1 : Formally state the null and alternative hypotheses
Step 2 : Determine the test statistic
Step 3 : Determine the critical value
Step 4 : Decision Rule



Given

Observed value : Sample mean     x= 5000 
Null Value (Expected mean under null hypothesis)     o= 4000   
Population standard deviation is unknown.
Use sample standard deviation s = 3000 as an estimate.
Significance  = 0.05
Sample size n = 16  ( small sample)

hypotheses

H0:=4000    True mean salary is €4000
Ha:4000    True mean salary is  not €4000

Test statistic

Remember the general structure of a test statistic

TS =Observed Value-Null ValueStd. Error 



Standard Error		S.E.(x) =sn=300016= 750

Test Statistic		x-0S.E.(X)=5000 -4 000750= 1.33


Critical values

The sample size (n=16) is small (n30). Use t distribution with n-1 degrees of Freedom.


The test is two tailed.  k= 2  ( "" symbol in the alternative hypothesis).


Column = k =0.052= 0.025


Murdoch Barnes table 7


Row: df = 15         (n-1)

Column = 0.025

Critical value =  2.131 


Decision rule


Is the test statistic value greater than the critical value?

If Yes: we reject the null hypothesis

If No: We fail to reject the null hypothesis. (not enough evidence)


Here TS = 1.33  is not greater than CV = 2.131.


We fail to reject the null hypothesis. We can not rightly say that the mean salary is not €4000 per month.


ii)      What assumption is made in this testing procedure? Is this assumption reasonable?  (2 marks)

The assumption made in this testing procedure is that salaries are normally distributed.
This is not a valid assumption as the distribution of salaries is known to be skewed (lots of low values, few high values).







b) A survey of 1000 Irish indicates that 750 have access to the Internet. A survey of 2000 Spaniards indicates that 1400 have access to the Internet.

i)        By calculating the appropriate p-value, test the hypothesis that the proportion of all Irish having access to the Internet
is equal to the proportion of all Spaniards having access to the internet at a significance level of 5%. (8 marks)


Step 1 : Formally state the null and alternative hypotheses

Step 2 : Determine the test statistic
Step 3a : Determine the p.value
Step 4a : Decision Rule for p-values.



Step 1 : Formally state the null and alternative hypotheses

Proportion of people having internet access is the same in both Ireland and Spain
Proportion of people having internet access differs in Ireland and Spain


Alternatively we write the hypotheses as follows (the null value is more evident).





Step 2 Compute the Test Statistic

pIrl=7501000= 0.75 
pEsp=14002000= 0.70

Observed Difference = 0.75 - 0.70 = 0.05  

Now lets compute the standard error (from Formulae)


ii)      Calculate a 99% confidence interval for the difference between the proportion of all Irish having access to the
Internet and the proportion of all Spaniards having access to the internet.  (4 marks)

Q5. a) Assume that the amount of wine poured into a bottle has a normal distribution with a mean of 750ml and a variance of 144ml$^2$.

\begin{itemize}

\item[(i)]  Calculate the probability that a bottle contains more than 765ml. (2 marks)
\item[(ii)]    Calculate the probability that a bottle contains between 744ml and 759ml. (3 marks)
\end{itemize}
%=========================================================== %
A machine fills bags with animal feed. The nominal weight of a bag is 50kg.
Because random variations the weight of a filled bag is normally distributed
$N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. The variance ($\sigma^2$) is known to be 0.01kg$^2$ and $\mu$ is set by the
operator to a particular value.

(i) If ? = 50kg calculate the probability of a bag containing less than
49.95kg?
(ii) Calculate the value of "?" such that only $2\%$ of the output are under the
nominal weight?
