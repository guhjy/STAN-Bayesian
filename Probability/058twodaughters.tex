Consider couplse that have two children. Treating the gender of the children as an \textit{\textbf{ordered pair}} outcome of a random experiment, the sample space is 
\[\boldsymbol{S} = \{ (b,b), (b,g), (g,b), (g,g)\}.\]
Let us assume that each sample point is \textit{\textbf{equiprobable}}, with probability 0.25 for each sample point.

 Find the probability that both children are girls if it is known that: 

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] at least one of the children is a girl,
\item[(b)] the older child is a girl. 	
\end{itemize}
