	\begin{itemize}
	\item	A complete list of all possible outcomes of a random experiment is called \textbf{sample space }or possibility space and is denoted by $\mathcal{S}$.
		
		
	\item	A sample space is a set or collection of outcome of a particular random experiment.
		
	\item 	For example, imagine a dart board. You are trying to find the probability of getting a bullseye. The dart board is the sample space. The probability of a dart hitting the dart board is 1.0.
	\item For another example, imagine rolling a six sided die. The sample space is $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.
	\end{itemize}

\item	The tossing of a coin, sample space is $\{Heads, Tails\}$.
	
\item 	The roll of a die, sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
