\textbf{Discrete Random Variables}

A random variable is a numerical description of the outcome of an experiment.

Random variables can be classified as discrete or continuous, depending on the numerical values they may take.

A ranom variable that may assume any numerical value in an interval or collection of intervals is called a continuous random variable.
