lme4 package
===============
lme4 is a project led by Douglas Bates (one of the co-authors of nlme), looking at modernizing the code and
making room for trying new ideas. On the positive side, it seems to be a bit faster than nlme and it deals 
a lot better with cross-classified random factors. lme4 doesnâ€™t deal with covariance and correlation structures yet.

One difference between the two packages is that nlme reports standard deviations instead of variances for
the random effects.
