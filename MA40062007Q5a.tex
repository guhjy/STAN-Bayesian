The vibrations in an elastic string are governed by the one dimensional wave equation
 
  
\[U_{tt}=C^2U_{xx} \]
 
where
u(x; t) is the deflection in the string.
 
Consider the case where the string is fixed at the ends x = 0 and x = l.
 
Let the initial deflection in the string be denoted by $u(x; 0) = f(x)
4 and the initial velocity by $u_t(x; 0) = g(x)$.
 
Find a solution of the wave equation to satisfy the boundary and initial conditions laid out
above.
