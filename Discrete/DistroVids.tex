Suppose a gambler is playing a simple coin flip game. 
The gambler does not know that the coin has been tampered with such that the probability of a Head is 47\%.

Suppose the gamble plays this coin flip game nine times. 
What is the probability that he wins precisely 3 times.

A researcher takes a random sample of 500 urban residents and finds that
122 have fibre-optic broadband access. Calculate a 90% Confidence Interval for
the true percentage of residents who have fibre-optic broadband access.

The following table gives the results of operations in a hospital according to the complexity of the
operation.

& & \\ \hline
Successful & 1990 & 950 \\ \hline
Unsuccessful & 10 & 50\\ \hline

Let A be the event that an operation is simple and B be the event that an
operation is successful. Calculate P r(B), P r(A|B), P r(A|BC ), P r(B|A) and
P r(B âˆ© A).
