WinBUGS code for question 1 of exercise 4

The single observation of y = 3 asthma deaths in a city of 200,000 is assumed to be a realisation of a Poisson random variable with mean 2.0*theta (the "2" is for the 2 x 100,000 people where theta is the rate per 100,000 persons per year) where theta represents the true long-term underlying astha rate in this city (measured in cases per 100,000 persons per year):

	y ~ Poisson(lamdba)
	lambda <- 2*theta

in the code below we replace the "2" in "2*theta" with "(n/100000)*theta" where n is 200,000 since it will be easier to generalise when preparing code for part (b) of the question.  Gelman et al. use a gamma(3.0,5.0) prior distribution for the asthma mortality rate:

	theta ~ dgamma(3.0,5.0)
	
	BUGS language for calculating the posterior probability that the rate is bigger than 2 per 100,000 persons per year:

Data 

	list(y  = c(3), n= c(200000))
	
Inits  

	list(theta = c(1.5))

WinBUGS code for question 2 of exercise 4

The single observation of y = 3 asthma deaths in a city of 200,000 is assumed to be a realisation of a Poisson random variable with mean 2.0*theta (the "2" is for the 2 x 100,000 people where theta is the rate per 100,000 persons per year) where theta represents the true long-term underlying astha rate in this city (measured in cases per 100,000 persons per year).  The Australian rate in 2002 was 397 deaths for a population of about 20 million.  We declare y[1] and y[2] to be the number of asthma deaths in the hypothetical city of n[1] = 200,000 people and Australia (n[2] = 20 million people) respectively.  The parameters theta[1] and theta[2] are the corresponding rates per 100,000 persons per year, with lambda[i], the product of the population and rate representing the Poisson parameter:

	y[i] ~ Poisson(lamdba[i])
	lambda[i] <- n[i]*theta[i]

Gelman et al. use a gamma(3.0,5.0) prior distribution for the asthma mortality rate, and we'll use this for theta[1] and theta[2]:

	theta[i] ~ dgamma(3.0,5.0)
