\begin{enumerate}
\item 95\% of students at school weigh between 62 kg and 90 kg.
Assuming this data is normally distributed, what are the mean and standard deviation?

\item A machine produces electrical components.
99.7\% of the components have lengths between 1.176 cm and 1.224 cm.
Assuming this data is normally distributed, what are the mean and standard deviation?

\item 68\% of the marks in a test are between 52 and 64
Assuming this data is normally distributed, what are the mean and standard deviation?

	\begin{enumerate}
\item The Fresha Tea Company pack tea in bags marked as 250 g
A large number of packs of tea were weighed and the mean and standard deviation were calculated as 255 g and 2.5 g respectively.
Assuming this data is normally distributed, what percentage of packs are underweight?

\item Students pass a test if they score 50\% or more.

The marks of a large number of students were sampled and the mean and standard deviation were calculated as 42\% and 8\% respectively.

Assuming this data is normally distributed, what percentage of students pass the test?
