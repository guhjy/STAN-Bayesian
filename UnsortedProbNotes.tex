How to Compute Probability: Equally Likely Outcomes
Sometimes, a statistical experiment can have n possible outcomes, each of which is equally likely. Suppose a subset of r outcomes are classified as "successful" outcomes.

The probability that the experiment results in a successful outcome (S) is:

P(S) = ( Number of successful outcomes ) / ( Total number of equally likely outcomes ) = r / n

Consider the following experiment. An urn has 10 marbles. Two marbles are red, three are green, and five are blue. If an experimenter randomly selects 1 marble from the urn, what is the probability that it will be green?

In this experiment, there are 10 equally likely outcomes, three of which are green marbles. Therefore, the probability of choosing a green marble is 3/10 or 0.30.

\begin{itemize}
\item Conditional probability
\item Independent events
\item Repeated independent events
\end{itemize}

\section{Mutually Exclusive Events}
Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot happen at the same time.
\[ P(A and B) = P(A) + P(B) \]

\section{Quantiles}

The quantile (this term was first used by Kendall, 1940) of a distribution of values is a number xp such that a proportion p of the population values are less than or equal to xp. For example, the .25 quantile (also referred to as the 25th percentile or lower quartile) of a variable is a value (xp) such that $25\%$ (p) of the values of the variable fall below that value.

Similarly, the $0.75$ quantile (also referred to as the 75th percentile or upper quartile) is a value such that $75\%$ of the values of the variable fall below that value and is calculated accordingly.

\section{Probability Distribution}

A statistical function that describes all the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range. This range will be between the minimum and maximum statistically possible values, but where the possible value is likely to be plotted on the probability distribution depends on a number of factors, including the distributions mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis.



\section {The binomial distribution }

The binomial distribution  is a discrete probability distribution that is applicable as a model for decisionmaking
situations in which a sampling process can be assumed to conform to a Bernoulli process. A Bernoulli
process is a sampling process in which
(1) Only two mutually exclusive possible outcomes are possible in each trial, or observation. For
convenience these are called success and failure.
(2) The outcomes in the series of trials, or observations, constitute independent events.
(3) The probability of success in each trial, denoted by p, remains constant from trial to trial. That is,
the process is stationary.
The binomial distribution can be used to determine the probability of obtaining a designated number of
successes in a Bernoulli process. Three values are required: the designated number of successes (X); the number
of trials, or observations (n); and the probability of success in each trial (p). Where $q = (1 - p)$, the formula for
determining the probability of a specific number of successes X for a binomial distribution is

\[ \mbox{Formula} \]

\section {The hypergeometric distribution }

When sampling is done without replacement of each sampled item taken from a finite population of items, the
Bernoulli process does not apply because there is a systematic change in the probability of success as items are
removed from the population. When sampling without replacement is used in a situation that would otherwise
qualify as a Bernoulli process, the hypergeometric distribution is the appropriate discrete probability distribution.
Given that X is the designated number of successes, N is the total number of items in the population, T is
the total number of successes included in the population, and n is the number of items in the sample, the formula
for determining hypergeometric probabilities is

A machine fills bags with animal feed. The nominal weight of a bag is 50kg.
Because random variations the weight of a filled bag is normally distributed
$N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. The variance ($\sigma^2$) is known to be 0.01kg$^2$ and $\mu$ is set by the
operator to a particular value.

(i) If ? = 50kg calculate the probability of a bag containing less than
49.95kg?
(ii) Calculate the value of "?" such that only $2\%$ of the output are under the
nominal weight?

\section*{Question 1 : Probability Distribution}

\subsection*{Introduction}{\LARGE Consider playing a game in which you are winning when a \textbf{\emph{fair die}} is showing `six'
	and losing otherwise.}
\subsection*{Part 1}{\LARGE If you play three such games in a row, find the probability mass function (pmf) of the number
	X of times you have won.}

{\LARGE
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Firstly: what type of probability distribution is this?
		
		\item Is this the distribution \textbf{\emph{discrete}} or  \textbf{\emph{continuous}}?
		
		\item The outcomes are whole numbers - so the answer is discrete.
		
		\item So which type of discrete distribution? (We have two to choose from. See first page of formulae)
		
		
		\item \textbf{Binomial:} characterizing the number of \textbf{\emph{successes}} in a series of \textbf{\emph{$n$ independent trials}}, with the \textbf{\emph{probability of a success}} in each trial being $p$.
		
		\item \textbf{Poisson:}  characterizing the \textbf{\emph{number of occurrences}} in a \textbf{\emph{unit space}} (i.e. a unit length, unit area or unit volume, or a unit period in time), where $\lambda$ is the the number of occurrences per unit space.
