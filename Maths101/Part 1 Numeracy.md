####Quotients and Remainders

A "quotient" is the result of a division problem. 

For example: For 6/3, "2" is the quotient, 6 is the dividend, and 3 is the divisor. 

The remainder is the number "left over" in a division problem when you're only interested in whole numbers 
(i.e. no decimals or fractions in the answer). 

For example, in 5/2, the quotient is "2" and the remainder is "1." 

If you take some of the more advanced math courses, you'll also see the remainder referred to as the "modulus," 
and coming in useful in many applications
