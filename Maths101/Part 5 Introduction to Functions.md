###Functions
A function is a relationship between two sets of numbers. 
We may think of this as a mapping; a function maps a number in one set to a number in another set. Notice that a function maps values to one and only one value. Two values in one set could map to one value, 
but one value must never map to two values: that would be a relation, not a function.

One important kind of relation is the function. A function is a relation that has exactly one output for every possible input in the domain. (The domain does not necessarily have to include all possible objects of a given type. In fact, we sometimes intentionally use a restricted domain in order to satisfy some desirable property.) 

The relations discussed above (flavors of fruits and fruits of a given flavor) are not functions: the first has two possible outputs for the input "apples" (sweetness and tartness); and the second has two outputs for both "sweetness" (apples and bananas) and "tartness" (apples and oranges).
