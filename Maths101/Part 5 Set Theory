Part 5: Set Theory
=============================
### Introduction to Set Theory

Set theory is concerned with the concept of a set, essentially a collection of objects that we call elements. 
Because of its generality, set theory forms the foundation of nearly every other part of mathematics

### What is a Set?

A mathematical set is defined as an unordered collection of distinct elements. That is, elements of a set can be listed in any order and elements occurring more than once are equivalent to occurring only once.
 
We say that an element is a member of a set. An element of a set can be anything. It's easiest to begin with only numbers as elements. For that reason, most of the examples in this book will only include numbers, but this is only a technique to make the topic less abstract.

### set operations

Based on the preceding definitions, we can derive some useful properties for the operations on sets. The proofs of these properties are left as an exercise to the reader.
 
The union and intersection operations are ***symmetric***.
