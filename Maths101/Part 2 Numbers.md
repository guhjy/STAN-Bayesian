### Prime Numbers
Prime numbers are the building blocks of the integers. A prime number is a positive integer greater than one that has only two divisors: 1, and the number itself. For example, 17 is prime because the only positive integers that divide evenly into it are 1 and 17. The number 6 is not a prime since more than two divsors 1, 2, 3, 6 divide 6. Also, note that 1 is not a prime since 1 has only one divisor.
