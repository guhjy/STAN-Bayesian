In cases where there are repeated measurements by each of the two
methods on the same subjects , Bland Altman suggest calculating
the mean for each method on each subject and use these pairs of
means to compare the two methods.

The estimate of bias will be unaffected using this approach, but
the estimate of the standard deviation of the differences will be
too small, because of the reduction of the effect of repeated
measurement error. Bland Altman propose a correction for this.
