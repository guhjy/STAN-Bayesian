\frametitle{Binomial Example: Sample Problem}

\textbf{Solution:}
Since only one out of five possible answers is correct, the probability of answering a question correctly by random is $1/5=0.2$. We can find the probability of having exactly 4 correct answers by random attempts as follows.(Blackboard. Correct Answer is 13.29\%)
%\begin{verbatim}
%> dbinom(4, size=12, prob=0.2)
%[1] 0.1329
%\end{verbatim}
