\frametitle{Conditional Probability}
Suppose $B$ is an event in a sample space $S$ with $P(B) > 0$.
The probability that an event $A$ occurs once $B$has occurred or, specifically, the
conditional probability of A given $B$ (written $P(A|B)$), is defined as follows:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}\]

\begin{itemize}
\item This can be expressed as a multiplication theorem
\[ P(A\cap B) = P(A|B)\times P(B) \]
\item The symbol $|$ is a vertical line and does not imply division.
\item Also $P(A|B)$ is not the same as $P(B|A)$.
\end{itemize}

\frame{
\frametitle{Independent Events}
Events A and B in a probability space $S$ are said to be independent if the
occurrence of one of them does not influence the occurrence of the other.\\ \bigskip

More specifically, $B$ is independent of A if $P(B)$ is the same as $P(B|A)$. Now
substituting $P(B)$ for $P(B|A)$ in the multiplication theorem from the previous
slide yields.
\[ P(A\cap B) = P(A)\times P(B)\]
We formally use the above equation as our definition of independence.

\frame{
\frametitle{Mutually Exclusive Events}
\begin{itemize}
\item Two events are mutually exclusive (or disjoint) if it is impossible for
them to occur together.
\item Formally, two events $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive if and only if
$A\cap B$ = $\varnothing$ \end{itemize}\bigskip
Consider our die example
\begin{itemize} 
\item Event A = `observe an odd number' = $\{1,3,5\}$
\item Event B = `observe an even number' = $\{2,4,6\}$

\item $A\cap B$ = $\varnothing$ (i.e. the empty set), so $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive.
\end{itemize}
}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\frame{
\frametitle{Addition Rule}
The addition rule is a result used to determine the probability that event $A$ or
event $B$ occurs or both occur. The result is often written as follows, using set
notation:
\[ P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)- P(A \cap B)\] 
\begin{itemize}
\item $P(A)$ = probability that event $A$ occurs.
\item $P(B)$ = probability that event $B$ occurs.
\item $P(A\cup B)$ = probability that either event $A$ or event $B$ occurs, or both
occur.
\item $P(A\cap B)$ = probability that event $A$ and event $B$ both occur.
\end{itemize}\bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Remark:} $P(A\cap B)$ is subtracted to prevent the relevant outcomes being
counted twice.


}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\frame{
\frametitle{Addition Rule (Continued)}
For mutually exclusive events, that is events which cannot occur together:
$P(A\cap B) = 0$. The addition rule therefore reduces to
\[ P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\]

\frametitle{Addition Rule: Worked Example}
Suppose we wish to find the probability of drawing either a Queen or a Heart
in a single draw from a pack of 52 playing cards. We define the events $Q$ =
`draw a queen' and $H$ = `draw a heart'.
\begin{itemize}
\item $P(Q)$ probability that a random selected card is a Queen
\item  $P(H)$ probability that a randomly selected card is a Heart.
\item  $P(Q\cap H)$ probability that a randomly selected card is the Queen of
Hearts.
\item  $P(Q\cup H)$ probability that a randomly selected card is a Queen or a Heart.
\end{itemize}
}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\frame{
\frametitle{Solution}
\begin{itemize} 
\item Since there are 4 Queens in the pack and 13 Hearts, so the $P(Q)$ = $4/52$
and $P(H) = 13/52$ respectively.
\item The probability of selecting the Queen of Hearts is $P(Q\cap H) = 1/52$.
\item We use the addition rule to find $P(Q\cup H)$:
\[ P(Q\cup H) = (4/52) + (13/52) - (1/52) = 16/52 \]
\item So, the probability of drawing either a queen or a heart is
$16/52 (= 4/13)$.
\end{itemize}

	\frametitle{Multiplication Rule}
	The multiplication rule is a result used to determine the probability that two events, $A$ and $B$, both occur.
	The multiplication rule follows from the definition of conditional probability.\\ \bigskip
	
	The result is often written as follows, using set notation:
	\[ P(A|B)\times P(B) = P(B|A)\times P(A) \qquad \left( = P(A \cap B) \right) \]
	
	Recall that for independent events, that is events which have no influence on one another, the rule simplifies to:
	\[P(A \cap B)  = P(A)\times P(B) \]

		\item $P(F|E)\times P(E) = 0.55 \times 0.40  = 0.22$

\frame{
	\frametitle{Law of Total Probability}
	The law of total probability is a fundamental rule relating marginal probabilities to conditional probabilities. The result is often written as follows, using set notation:
	\[ P(A)  = P(A \cap B) + P(A \cap B^c) \]
	
	where $P(A \cap B^c)$ is probability that event $A$ occurs and $B$ does not.\\ \bigskip
	
	
	Using the multiplication rule, this can be expressed as
	\[ P(A) = P(A | B)\times P(B) + P(A | B^{c})\times P(B^{c}) \]
}
%------------------------------------------------------------%
\frame{

	From the first year intake example , check that
	\[ P(E)  = P(E \cap M) + P(E \cap F) \]
	with $ P(E) = 0.40$, $ P(E \cap M) = 0.18$ and  $ P(E \cap F) = 0.22$
	\[ 0.40  = 0.18 + 0.22 \]
	\textbf{Remark:}  $M$ and $F$ are complement events.

	\frametitle{Bayes' Theorem}
	Bayes' Theorem is a result that allows new information to be used to update the conditional probability of an event.
	\bigskip
	
	Recall the definition of conditional probability:
	\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \]
	
	
	Using the multiplication rule, gives Bayes' Theorem in its simplest form:
	
	\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)\times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

	An electronics assembly subcontractor receives resistors from two suppliers: Deltatech provides
	70\% of the subcontractors's resistors while another company, Echelon, supplies the remainder.
	\\
	1\% of the resistors provided by Deltatech fail the quality control test, while 2\% of the
	resistors from Echelon also fail the quality control test.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item What is the probability that a resistor will fail the quality control test?
		\item What is the probability that a resistor that fails the quality control test was supplied by Echelon?
	\end{enumerate}
}

%------------------------------------------------------------%

\frame{
	\frametitle{Probability: Worked Example}
	Firstly, let's assign names to each event.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $D$ : a randomly chosen resistor comes from Deltatech.
		\item $E$ : a randomly chosen resistor comes from Echelon.
		\item $F$ : a randomly chosen resistor fails the quality control test.
		\item $P$ : a randomly chosen resistor passes the quality control test.
	\end{itemize}
	\bigskip
	We are given (or can deduce) the following probabilities:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $P(D) = 0.70$,
		\item $P(E) = 0.30$.
	\end{itemize}
	
}
%------------------------------------------------------------%

\frame{
	\frametitle{Probability: Worked Example}
	
	We are given two more important pieces of information:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The probability that a randomly chosen resistor fails the quality control test, given that it comes from Deltatech: $P(F|D) = 0.01 $.
		\item The probability that a randomly chosen resistor fails the quality control test, given that it comes from Echelon: $P(F|E) = 0.02$.
	\end{itemize}
	
}
%------------------------------------------------------------%

\frame{
	\frametitle{Probability: Worked Example}
	
	The first question asks us to compute the probability that a randomly chosen resistor fails the quality control test. i.e. $P(F)$.\\
	\bigskip
	All resistors come from either Deltatech or Echelon. So, using the \textbf{\emph{law of total probability}}, we can express $P(F)$ as follows:
	
	\[ P(F)  = P(F \cap D) + P(F \cap E) \]
	
}

%------------------------------------------------------------%

\frame{
	\frametitle{Probability: Worked Example}
	
	Using the \textbf{\emph{multiplication rule}}  i.e. $P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) \times P(B)$, we can re-express the formula as follows
	
	\[ P(F)  = P(F|D) \times P(D) + P(F|E) \times P(E) \]
	
	We have all the necessary probabilities to solve this.
	
	\[ P(F)  = 0.01 \times 0.70 + 0.02 \times 0.30   = 0.007 + 0.006  = 0.013\]

	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		The second question asks us to compute probability that a resistor that fails the quality control test was supplied by Echelon.
		\item In other words; of the resistors that did fail the quality test only, what is the probability that a randomly selected resistor was supplied by Echelon?
		\item We can express this mathematically as $P(E|F)$.
		\item We can use \textbf{\emph{Bayes' theorem}} to compute the answer.
